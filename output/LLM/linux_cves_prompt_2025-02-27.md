    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retry\n\nWhen a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will call\ncifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the op\nbefore renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() which\ninvokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.\n\nIf a different server is then selected, this causes the increment of\nserver->in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happen\nagainst another, leading to misaccounting.\n\nFix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As this\nis only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() should\nalways have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and the\npreparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.\n\nThe problem manifests as a warning looking something like:\n\n WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 72896 at fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c:97 smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs]\n ...\n RIP: 0010:smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs]\n ...\n  smb2_writev_callback+0x334/0x560 [cifs]\n  cifs_demultiplex_thread+0x77a/0x11b0 [cifs]\n  kthread+0x187/0x1d0\n  ret_from_fork+0x34/0x60\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nWhich may be triggered by a number of different xfstests running against an\nAzure server in multichannel mode.  generic/249 seems the most repeatable,\nbut generic/215, generic/249 and generic/308 may also show it.",

    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",

Due to improper validation of file paths between Windows and Linux environments, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete any file on the system. The issue arises from the lack of adequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'del_preset' endpoint, where the application fails to prevent the use of absolute paths or directory traversal sequences ('..'). As a result, an attacker can send a specially crafted request to the 'del_preset' endpoint to delete files outside of the intended directory.",
